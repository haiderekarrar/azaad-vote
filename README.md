## Azaad Vote

# About

This project was created to facilitate voters in Pakistan to find their local voting information for Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaaf candidates. This is especially important because there is a nationwide crackdown and disinformation campaign against the party to put it on unequal footing for the elections. The purpose of the project is thus to help counter the undemocratic elements within the country.
